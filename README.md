A very simple circuit using a 555 timer and a counting IC. 

Have you seen the electronic descision makers on the market? A number of models have been released. Most retail for around $15 to $30 and come in a variety of styles displaying either "HEADS/TAILS" or "YES" and "NO" or "DO IT NOW/DO IT TOMORROW". Effectively they are all the same â€” consisting of 2 red LEDS on a colourful background displaying the appropriate messages. They make a wonderful gift for a procrastinator or as a party game. A push button starts the LEDs flashing and they gradually slow down to a stable state of either yes or no. Basically, this project performs the same task. Except that it doesn't have the sophistication of allowing the LEDs to slow down before locking into one stable state. However, this breadboard project could be fitted into a small box and with a little imagination a colourful front panel could be designed to brighten it up and save yourself a lot of money over the bought model. Two very simple panels are included here to give you ideas to work from. The circuit for the HEADS or TAILS project uses IC's and 2 LEDs. The first IC is a 555 timer. The time-constant components comprising the 10k resistor R1 and .1mfd capacitor C1 have been chosen to enable the timer to oscillate at a frequency of 1500 Hz. The output at pin 3 feeds directly into the second IC, a CD 4017 decade counter. It is capable of counting up to ten then setting automatically to begin again. The IC can be programmed or to put it another way, can be adjusted to count up to 2,3,4,5,6,7,8 or 9 simply by connecting the next output to the reset pin. For instance: If you wish to count to 7, connect output 8 to the reset pin and the IC will count to 7 then reset again. In this project we use only the first two outputs: pin 3 is the first output and pin 2 is the second output. The outputs do not correspond to the IC pin numbers but happen to fall in this order: 3-2-4-10-1-5-6-9-11. If we connect the third output (pin 4) to the reset pin 15, the IC will clock from 3 to 2 then reset back to 3 again. In other words it will oscillate between 3 and 2 at 750Hz at each output. Actually we are using a very complex IC for this simple project however, we will be utilizing more of the IC in the next project so don't worry about the cost at this stage.
